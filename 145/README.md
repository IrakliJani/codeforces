Petya loves lucky numbers very much. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal record contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

Petya has two strings a and b of the same length n. The strings consist only of lucky digits. Petya can perform operations of two types:

replace any one digit from string a by its opposite (i.e., replace 4 by 7 and 7 by 4);
swap any pair of digits in string a.
Petya is interested in the minimum number of operations that are needed to make string a equal to string b. Help him with the task.

## Input
The first and the second line contains strings a and b, correspondingly. Strings a and b have equal lengths and contain only lucky digits. The strings are not empty, their length does not exceed 105.

## Output
Print on the single line the single number â€” the minimum number of operations needed to convert string a into string b.
